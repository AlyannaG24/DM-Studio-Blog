I played around with a lot of different colour schemes and types of colour paletts (monochromatic, complementary, analogous and tridaic). I espacially liked the complementary and analogous palettes because they give the icons much more interst and depth. The complementary palettes gave contrasting colours much bolder designs and details were able to standout more, while analogous palettes had colours that harmonised well without actually blending the shapes and loosing the image. 
I think I will go for a split complementary palette as it gives a mix of the depth and contrast of the complementary palette and the harmony of the analogous palettes. 


# Session 2
## Iterations of Icons

During this time I was working through creating all 18 icons and I ran into some minor issues whilst translating the sketches into designs in Illustraitor. Some sketches I did I felt did not work well as a flat 2D icon design, especially with my chosen style using no outlines, but only shifts in value/saturation to show shadow, depth and differentiate parts. 
Some sketches, like the Inventory bag, worked much better as the changed icon design so I had to reverse the thought process to create the initial unchaged icon design. The initial sketch of the inventory bag had it open with stars jumping out, I thoguht that an effective design would be if the bag was first closed and when a player clicked on the icon, the bag would then open symbolisng opening the inventory menu. 
With the toy bear, I found it difficult to create its legs with only flat shapes, so I decicded to iterate on and modify the design so the legs went stright down instead of a sitting position. I thoguht this somewhat emulated how a child would hold a teddy bear and its legs would be dangling.

In revisiting my platform, context and audience. I believe I would keep things mostly the same: a Video game where the character is in a dreamworld and the icons are the game's menu UI. However, After doing the colour swatches and experiemnts, I really enjoyed the bright pastels and ultimately decided that that coour palette would suit my dream-like icons more than an unsaturated unsettling liminal space-like palette. This could mean the spookier elements of my intened game platform would not match or make sense, however I still believe it could as like a contrast between a cutesy menu aesthetic and spookier gameplay.
