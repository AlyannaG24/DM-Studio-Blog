I played around with a lot of different colour schemes and types of colour paletts (monochromatic, complementary, analogous and tridaic). I espacially liked the complementary and analogous palettes because they give the icons much more interst and depth. The complementary palettes gave contrasting colours much bolder designs and details were able to standout more, while analogous palettes had colours that harmonised well without actually blending the shapes and loosing the image. 
I think I will go for a split complementary palette as it gives a mix of the depth and contrast of the complementary palette and the harmony of the analogous palettes.
