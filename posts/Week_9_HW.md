# Session 1
## Unity Playtesting

This is the first test play of my partner through unity play. It was super slow and laggy adn we wern't sure how to fix it. Eventually, we tried a different browser and it worked a bit better in the second play test. The audio also did not work during any playtesting.

Now, using a different browser, my partner could roughly make his way through the whole floor. We didn't notice too many issues, however I know he must've missed a lot due to the lag.

# Session 2
## In-class playtesting
In class, we all playtested and reviewed our classmates' work so far. I got some great feedback which I implemented such as adding more sound, so I decided to ass a backing track over the whole game, and being able to go back from the truck and final city room as before I didn't want players to be abel to go back to symbolise not ebing able to simply revisit my old homes.
I also fixed the glitchy overlapping textures of the floors in the final city room.
