# Unity Playtesting
https://youtu.be/ZVSPLQCvttA
This is the first test play of my partner through unity play. It was super slow and laggy adn we wern't sure how to fix it. Eventually, we tried a different browser and it worked a bit better in the second play test. The audio also did not work during any playtesting.

Now, using a different browser, my partner could roughly make his way through the whole floor. We didn't notice too many issues, however I know he must've missed a lot due to the lag.
