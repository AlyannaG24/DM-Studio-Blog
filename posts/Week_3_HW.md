In producing this draft, I tried to express the tone and emotions subtly through short clips and timing of the backing music. I didn't put much thought into the order of the video because I was first just trying to put my vague ideas onto the timeline and build from there, adding to this I should also keep lighting in mind. I wanted to keep the sound effects minimal to keep its 'snapshot into life' feeling as well as emphasising the emptiness and isolation of the first part with the lack of sounds. I am wanting some specific shots, such as the cups, to be parallels and show the difference and developemnt in mood (from being alone one cup to to being with others many cups and talking in the background. I really wanted a smooth transition during the turning point (from computer shutdown to door opening), for a relatively seamless cut, I ended the computer shot into darkness and started the door shot from darkness.

For the backing music, I used 'As Your World Grows Smaller' by Diffie Bosman on Bensound for its dreamy-droney feel and how it changed key and transfroms into a warmer comfortable beat around halfway. I believe that the first part of the music really adds to the isolated desolate feel of the first part being isolated inside the house. I also used sound effects from free sound to add to the world and make it seem more realisitc, Eg. clock sounds, bird sounds etc.

Moving forward, I want to work on unifying my clips to have more of an impact through lighting and setting. I also believe that the timing of the clips should be chanegd, from longer consistant times in the first part and shorter clips that grow shorter as it reaches the climax of the fireworks. I also want to utilise L cuts and J cuts for the audio to build upon the scene and continuity.
