## Black Squares Activity

Being limited to the elememt of shape, I tried utilising space and negative space to create differeing interesting deigns. Using the shape tool I duplicated, resized and rotated the shape to create icons representitive of the prompts within the activity. I sometimes used different iterations of the same vague ideas with each promt to build upon my thoughts and create new feelings and meaning using the same base. I did this to see exactly how much I would need/like to change before I begin to find a new meaning in the icon idea.

## Mindmap of Assignment prompts

For example, instagram uses many icons for navigation and menu UI. Their target audience are teenagers and adults who use their platform, these are mainly people who like to share their life or keep in the loop about current events.
An example that really inspires me would be the game Animal Crossing. In this game you are put onto an island and must develop it into a cozy town. You are given a phone in the game which has a menu nagivation and icons. Personally, I am aiming to also create a set of menu navigation panels for my own created video game that is based on the theme of dreams. This game would be something along the lines of a puzzle adventure game where you, the main character, must complete quests along the story to progress and either escape the dream world you are trapped in, or travel between a dream world and the real world to achieve a goal. I would like it to have a cute yet offputting atmosphere, as in the dream world something is unnatural and not quite right. The target audience would be, teenagers and young adults who enjoy video games, specifically story, puzzle and adventure games.
