## Black Squares Activity

Being limited to the elememt of shape, I tried utilising space and negative space to create differeing interesting deigns. Using the shape tool I duplicated, resized and rotated the shape to create icons representitive of the prompts within the activity. I sometimes used different iterations of the same vague ideas with each promt to build upon my thoughts and create new feelings and meaning using the same base. I did this to see exactly how much I would need/like to change before I begin to find a new meaning in the icon idea.
