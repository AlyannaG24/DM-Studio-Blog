# Session 1
## Test Play with Adobe Illustraitor

## Black Squares Activity
![Black squares act](W4_blacksquares.png)
Being limited to the elememt of shape, I tried utilising space and negative space to create differeing interesting deigns. Using the shape tool I duplicated, resized and rotated the shape to create icons representitive of the prompts within the activity. I sometimes used different iterations of the same vague ideas with each promt to build upon my thoughts and create new feelings and meaning using the same base. I did this to see exactly how much I would need/like to change before I begin to find a new meaning in the icon idea.

## Mindmap of Assignment prompts
![Mindmap of themes](Mindmap_of_themes.png)
For example, instagram uses many icons for navigation and menu UI. Their target audience are teenagers and adults who use their platform, these are mainly people who like to share their life or keep in the loop about current events.
An example that really inspires me would be the game Animal Crossing. In this game you are put onto an island and must develop it into a cozy town. You are given a phone in the game which has a menu nagivation and icons. Personally, I am aiming to also create a set of menu navigation panels for my own created video game that is based on the theme of dreams. This game would be something along the lines of a puzzle adventure game where you, the main character, must complete quests along the story to progress and either escape the dream world you are trapped in, or travel between a dream world and the real world to achieve a goal. I would like it to have a cute yet offputting atmosphere, as in the dream world something is unnatural and not quite right. The target audience would be, teenagers and young adults who enjoy video games, specifically story, puzzle and adventure games.

# Session 2
## Thhumbnail Sketches
![concepts](Thhumbnailing_concepts.png)
I first listed what I belived to be my strongest conpects to come out of the mindmapping for the theme 'Dream'. I also listed common game menu UI as this is the context and platform the 9 icons so I would like to keep these in mind when deisgning the icons. I starred the concepts/game UI that I thought were weakest or difficult to conceptualise within the conext of game UI.

![bedroom](Thhumbnailing_bedroom.png)
This is the concept of bedroom that I think would be suited for the UI of Map. I think that my strongest sketches are the pillow, the lamp and the pillow fort, with the strongest being the pillow fort. I think that this uses a nice variety of curves and sharp corners to create visual interest.

![Childhood](Thhumbnailing_childhood.png)
This is the conpect of childhood which I think would be best suited for a character ui menu. Also the concept of childhood speaks to me as relating to dreams because I personally have vivid memories of dreams I had during my childhood and I also often dream about my childhood. I think that the teddy and rubber ducky sketch are my strongest, as they have a great use of shapes making a distinguishable silhouette.

![forget](Thhumbnailing_forget.png)
This is the concept of memory as sometimes I immediately forget some fo my dreams or they remain as vivid memories and I connected this to the save control. I believe that the erasing picture is the most visually interesting, however this doesnt really make sense to save progess in a game. I'd need to think about this concept more or flesh out the game where an 'erasing' picture make sense to save the games progress.

![inventory](Thhumbnailing_Inventory.png)
I did not have a concept fromt he mindmap I thought would mesh well with inventory, however, the inventory menu is something most games have so i thought it important enough to simply have despite it not having a dream concept tired to it. I tried to 'dreamify' inventory, and what I think is my strongest sketch is the starry pouch. It gives the feeling of a magical pouch (think bottomless space), and I think suits the dream aesthetic theme.

![nightmare](Thhumbnailing_nightmare.png)
For nightmare, I thought it could tie with an index menu, likely an index of the monsters or enemies youve met and keep a log on them. I think the ghost or the thought bubble with the face has the most interest with a mix of shape and line. However, I feel this is the weekest concept and game UI as it is not too essential for a game.

![puzzle](Thhumbnailing_puzzle.png)
For puzzle, I like the belief that dreams have hidden meanings and it feels like a puzzle you need to figure out to find out the true meaning. I linked this with quests as they are both tasks to do for a reward. I dont currently have many ideas for this concept, but I think the strongest sketch is the rubics cube of the 3D puzzle piece which gives form and also value.

![settings](Thhumbnailing_settings.png)
For settings, I also did not have a dream concept to link it to but I also thought it essential to game's UI so I added it anyway. At first I was very lost on what to do with this as the settings icon is already widely known as a cog or set of sliders, but I decided to try to 'dreamify' this too and came up with some ideas I liked. I think my strongest sketches are the cog with stars orbiting around it or the cog as a dreamcatcher. The cog with orbit is a simplier design but gets the message across well using both line and shape, while the dreamcatcher while most visually intersting may be a bit too busy for an icon design.

![sleep](Thhumbnailing_sleep.png)
I've linked sleep with exit and they are both vaguely about stopping activity. I think my strongest sketches are the sheep jumping over the fence or the baby mobile. The sheep design could be simplified and the idea of counting sheep is more intersting than the baby mobile and can utilise both straight and crved organic shapes. The baby mobile is much simpler in design, but feels unbalanced which can be fixed by resizing the moon and stars.

![story](Thhumbnailing_story.png)
The story design is linked with the history game UI. The main motif would be a book as it both represents stories and history, and in the context of a video game, history would allow players to keep track of the onging story, and maybe even items or other chatracters they've met along the way. This also makes the index (nightmare) concept redundant as that menu can simply be included in this menu. I think the strongest sketch is the book with stars jumping out, it combines both line anad shape and uses this reoccurring image of stars jumping out of the icon which can tie designs together for cohesion.

![wiah](Thhumbnailing_wish.png)
I did not have many ideas for the wish concept that ive tied to the achievements/rewards menu. I thoguht of the term 'wish upon a star' or wishing on a shooting star to mainly inspire me but I did not come up with many ideas. i also did a sparkler icon because it reminds me of when I was young I lit sparkers every new years and made my new years wish. I am unsure of which sketch is the strongest but I am leaning towards the stars with the orbit as it ties in with the settings with the orbit and its simplicity is appealing but has a mix of line and shape.
