Slowly I stared making furniture out of basic shapes and imported 3D model assets from freepik. I prioritised what I could and couldn't make from shapes to decide what I imported to make the most of the 10 imported 3D models limitation.

# Session 2

![Sounds](Sounds_1.png)
I realised I needed to add box colliders on my imported assets as I was play testing so I made sure to add them to all the assets. I also started adding sounds effects to each area to give it its own atmosphere and to add to immersion (eg. truck rev sounds when int he moving truck)
