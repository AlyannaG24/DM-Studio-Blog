# Coding and Sounds
In this assignment, we are to record and use our own sounds to play when you click in th icons. I initally recorded using natural sounds outside, eg rocks, leaves, tree bark, and i did like them however, thinking more about my icons and the theme of dream, I decided that more domestic sounds from inside my house would suit the theme more since that is where we sleep. I recorded sounds like fabric ruffling, scratching, cups, books etc to get a soft feeling sound that would fit in a game with a dreamy atmosphere.

We started coding in Visual Studio Code to put our icons into a website that can be deployed and accessed using a link. It was difficult to understand at first, but I started learning what certain commands meant what and I understood enough to get the website working with the icons changing and make sounds when clicked.
