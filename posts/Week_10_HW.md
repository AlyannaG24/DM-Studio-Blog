# Session 1

__Assignment 1 - Video Edit__
• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?
I tried to match the visual beats to the sound beats as much as I can. Some examples of this would be in the first half of my video I changed the scene every 4 beats to create a repretitve monotone montage aiding in a melancholic atmosphere. 
I also chose a backing soundtrack that had like a 'turning point' that really helped to punch in the shift in tone from the first (melancholic, foggy, isolated) to the second half (bright, loud, outdoors). 
As for sound effects I used a mix of diegetic and atmospheric sounds to enhance the mood I was going for for each scene. For example in the first half I used synthwaves and dreamy sounds almost like whispers to deliver a very ,again, monotone melancholic atmosphere, and in the second half I used mostly diegetic sounds to be more gounded in the real world and 'alive'. 
Then In that final scene I also brought back that moody red lighting with the synthwaves and the whispers to full the viewwer back from 'reality' and into that world of isolation from the start.

• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?


• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?


• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?


• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?


• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?
