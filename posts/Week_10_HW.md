# Session 1
## Self Reflections Questions

###Assignment 1 - Video Edit

*• How did you approach the relationship between the sonic and visual components of your edit?*

I tried to match the visual beats to the sound beats as much as I can. Some examples of this would be in the first half of my video I changed the scene every 4 beats to create a repretitve monotone montage aiding in a melancholic atmosphere. 
I also chose a backing soundtrack that had like a 'turning point' that really helped to punch in the shift in tone from the first (melancholic, foggy, isolated) to the second half (bright, loud, outdoors). 
As for sound effects I used a mix of diegetic and atmospheric sounds to enhance the mood I was going for for each scene. For example in the first half I used synthwaves and dreamy sounds almost like whispers to deliver a very ,again, monotone melancholic atmosphere, and in the second half I used mostly diegetic sounds to be more gounded in the real world and 'alive'. 
Then In that final scene I also brought back that moody red lighting with the synthwaves and the whispers to full the viewwer back from 'reality' and into that world of isolation from the start.



*• How did you decide on the footage that you used to shape your project?*

The most important elements of my video is the lighting of each scene as they really help shape the atmosphere. I decided on the footage with the best lighting for the effects I wanted to go for, the most dim and warm for the first half and the most bright and vibrant for the second half.



*• What did you learn about the power of sound to shape emotional experience, and how did you apply this knowledge to your project?*

I learnt a lot about the power of sound. Every element of the sounds contributes to the emotions experience from listening to it and one change to the sound can completely shift the emotional experience. I used a lot of atmosphereic sounds to shape the emotional experience when you watch my video.



*• How does editing relate to the concepts of pacing and rhythm, and how did you use these concepts to shape your use of time in the project?*

The editing controls the pacing and rhythm of the video which then controls the atmosphere, viewer consumtion of content and sense of time. I heavily relied on these tools to control the atmosphere and emotions of my video. I used a very rhythmic and repetitive backing sounds to help accentuate how the clips were all the same length, making for a monotone and dissonant atmosphere. Then to juxtapose that after the turning point, I used organic bird and outdoor sounds to complement the varying pace of clips that get faster and faster to build towards a 'climax'.



*• Which parts of your personality, interests, past, and potential future did you choose to depict in your portrait?*

I decided to depict the development of my emotional state from throughout highschool into my courrent journey of university. The first half represents my emotional state during most of highschool, very monotone, isolated and dimmly going thorugh the motions. Spending nights awake and contemplating were frequent occurrances, which mirrors the scene and setting of the first half. Towards the end of my final year in highschool is when my overall emotional state started to change when I entered a relationship and I was simply too busy with final exams whist also moving house twice to really stop and think. Once I moved to the city with my family and then started uni shortly after is when the turning point really happened. Going to uni really flipped my schedule with new experiences. I honestly had more downtime to decompress and explore the new area I've been thrust into, leading me to have much more freedom to just go outside and do things in the city. However, represented by that final scene that calls back the first half of the video, emotions are always fluctiating and hardly progress linearly. Whist I am now currently much better off than I was during highschool, I still have times when I feel the exact same as then, stuck alone in my room in the late hours of the night wondering if all the good times was just a dream (represented by the sort of tinnitus droning sounding effects, dreamy music, whispering effects, and heavy breathing as if just woken up startled).



*• What were the primary aesthetic choices that you made to express those ideas in your work?*

My primary aesthetic choices were to really develop the atmosphere and emotions of the video. I focused on lighting, audio and pacing to achieve this.

This video self-portrait reflects the emotional shift I went through moving from high school into university life. I structured the edit in two contrasting halves—starting with a monotone, isolated atmosphere and moving into something brighter and more alive—to mirror my own journey.

Lighting and sound were key to setting the tone. I chose footage based on how well it supported the mood I wanted: dim, warm lighting for the first half, and vibrant, natural light for the second. I synced visual cuts to the beat of the audio, especially early on, where each scene changes every four beats to create a repetitive, foggy feeling. The soundtrack I used has a clear turning point, which helped me mark the emotional shift in the video. After that moment, the pacing picks up and the edits become quicker and more varied to build toward a sense of release.

Sound design played a huge role. I used synths and whisper-like effects early on to create a dreamy, distant vibe, then transitioned to real-world sounds like birds and city noise to ground the second half in reality. In the final scene, I brought back those earlier, more isolated sounds to show that emotions don’t progress in a straight line—sometimes old feelings resurface.

This piece is about more than just a timeline of events—it’s about emotional texture. It captures what it felt like to be stuck in a cycle, to break out of it, and to realize that progress isn’t always linear. Through editing, sound, and pacing, I aimed to create a portrait that feels honest, atmospheric, and emotionally layered.


###Assignment 2 - Graphic Icons

*• How would you summarise your idea behind the suite of icons, and why did you choose the theme that you did?*

I was very inspired by the games 'Animal Crossing', 'Hello Kitty Island Adventure' and 'Genshin Impact' and their UI menu panels. I already knew when I read the assignment breif I wanted to create a video game UI menu panel, and as the breif required us to create 2D flat icons, these games immediately jumped to mind and I drew heavy inspiration for the general idea of how these icons could look shape and colour wise. 
With choosing which theme to base my icons on, I ultimately decided on dream after brainstorming for a few themes and finding that I had the most ideas about the dream theme and I was the most connected to that theme personally. 
With conceptualising the idea behind the game itself, I wanted something that went against the typical 'cutesy, soft and pastel' aesthetic that usually is associated with the word 'dream' and instead with something more psycological/thriller/liminal space themed nightmare almost. My vague ideas of the game this UI menu panel would be in was inspired by games like 'Omori', 'Refind Self', 'Little Miss Fortune' and 'Hollow Knight', an adventure puzzle game following a story.



*• Did you iterate through a series of approaches before settling on one? What changed across those iterations, and why did you choose the one that you ended up with?*

I had a good vision of what I wanted my final icons to look like when I started so I didn't go through many iterations. I did iterate and go through many colour options and palettes, and eventually decided against the initial idea of having a very dull monochrome colour palette and went with a very classically dreamy pastel pink, purple and yellow. I think this wouldn't really affect the themes of the game itself, as it could be a contrast to a more darker environemtn where it would take place to unbalance players.



*• How did you translate your thumbnail sketches into the final flat designs in Illustrator? Was anything lost in that translation, or gained?*

I didn't have too much trouble translating my thumbnail sketches into the final icon designs as I sketched them with already a good idea of the final flat design style I wanted. I only had one issue with the teddybear. I had trouble illustraiting the legs in a sitting position whilst showing depth so I changed it to a dangling position where the legs go stright down.
Other than that a slight issue that wasn't really an issue was that half of my sketches that I then created in Illustrator actually made more sense as the second icon that appeares after you click on it. So with this, half of my icons I brainstormed what would make sense to happen in the icon after I click and then the other half I brainstormed backwards - what would the icon look like before the click and change.



*• How did you use colour to create a sense of unity and visual interest in the icons? Why did you choose the palette that you did?*

After going through many, many, many colour palettes, I decided on a split complementary palette of pink, purple and yellow. I used this palette across all icons and minimally used different shades of each colour to create depth in the icon shape. I used a split complementary plaette to have a mix of soft whimsy (the pink and purples mixing together) and the yellow to create a contrasting accent and bring attention to the details. I've mentioned before my iteration on the colour palettes and final decision to go with a 'cuter' colour palette over a duller one. My reasoning for this was because I thought it looked more  visually interesting and helped contrast/accentuate certain details. 



*• How did the elements and principles of sound that you used in your audio design correspond to the elements and principles of design that you used in your visual design?*





*• How did you translate the prompt that you chose from an abstract idea to a set of concrete visual designs?*

I already knew after reading the assignment breif I wanted to create these icons int he context of a video game UI menu panel so I was brainstorming ideas to widen on this idea with this in mind. Initially, when I think of dream, I think of whimsical and soft but as a fan of more psychological thriller adventure games, I really wanted to adapt this theme of dreams to this genre. Like the games 'Omori' and 'Litte Miss Fortune', they present as magical and whimsical initially, but have a consistant darker underlying theme I also wanted to emulate.


<ins>Artist Statement - Assignmnet 2</ins>

For this project, I designed a suite of nine interactive 2D flat icons, each responding with a visual change and accompanying sound when clicked. I approached the task with the idea of building a fictional video game UI menu panel, inspired by the charming interfaces of Animal Crossing, Hello Kitty Island Adventure, and Genshin Impact. Video games have always inspired me visually—there’s something about their ability to blend aesthetic with functionality that makes them a perfect space for cool, expressive design. So, when I read the brief, I knew I wanted to explore that space.

The chosen theme was “dream,” and I initially wanted to subvert the usual soft and pastel associations by taking it in a darker, more psychological direction. Influenced by games like Omori, Little Misfortune, and Refind Self, I envisioned a UI that contrasts a sweet aesthetic with unsettling narrative undertones. While my early idea was to use a muted, eerie palette, through iteration I ended up choosing a split complementary scheme of pastel pinks, purples, and yellows. Though cuter than intended, it suited the icons better and still served the concept—creating a visual dissonance between the UI and the game world to subtly unbalance the player.

The visual translation from thumbnails to Illustrator was fairly smooth, with only small changes like adjusting the teddy bear’s legs for clarity. Interestingly, some icons ended up better suited as “changed” states, which led to reverse-engineering their original forms. I paired each transition with light, atmospheric sounds to create a satisfying and immersive interaction.

Overall, I used this assignment to channel my love of game design into something playful, cohesive, and just a little unsettling—like a dream that’s too perfect to be real.

###Assignment 3 - Virtual Environment

*• How important was a working prototype to your design process? What did it offer that process?*

A working prototype was very useful during the design process, just being able to see what each of actions added towards the final product was very helpful. A working prototype helped me to identify issues straight away, helped me to gague the scale of my 3d environments, helped me test if my game was navigable and more. It was most helpful in checking if things I added were working straight away, like the audios, backing music, box colliders, textures, shadows and builds. 



*• How did your experience of designing and producing a three-dimensional environment differ from your experience of designing and producing a project in two-dimensional media?*

This experience of designing and producing a 3D environemnt was very different from 2D media. Designing a 3D product involved a lot of planning, iterating and moving on by stages as a whole instead of getting one section done and implementing it then another. There was also the added aspect of play testing I haven't really done before, and I definitly understand its importance as I ran into so many problems with designing and producing the 3D environemnt which I discovered and solved through play testing.


*• What was the role of the virtual camera in your project, and how was it similar to and different from the role of the camera in Assignment 1?*

The virtual camera in Assignment 3 was similar to Assignemnt 1 in the way it was the point of view of the viewer, and allowed them to see what we wanted them to see. However, it was different in the way that in Assignment 1, the viewer had no control of the camera while in Assignment 3 the player controlled the camera/WAS the camera.


*• How did you use sound in your project, and how was this similar to and different from your use of sound in Assignments 1 and 2?*

My use of sound in Assignment 3 was similar to my use of sound in Assignment 1. I used it as a tool to enhance the atmosphere and give the viewers a better understanding of the environment and setting. I also used a backing track in both to set the overall emotions. The process of findng the audios and backing track was also the same in Assignment 1 and 3
I didn't use many sound effects in my Assignment 3 like Assignment 2 as I unfortunately did not have nay interactive elements in it.


*• How did you unify the different elements of your virtual environment under a certain theme or concept? How did your theme or concept evolve over the project’s development?*

The differernt encounters were already unified from the start as they all are stages from the same story. All the encounters are of my bedrooms across 3 houses/appartments with a brief aesthetic encounter outdoors in a moving van to clarify the story for players. To summarise, the story being the process of moving houses multiple times from the quiet suburbs to the bustling city in the middle of the final year 12 exams. My theme mainly stayed the same over the projects development but I added more and more details, props and 3D assets to help really conceptualise the environments as a part of the story and to show not tell the narrative.


*• What did you discover through the process of play testing that you wouldn’t have discovered otherwise?*

Through play testing, and especially getting outside feedback, I discovered many players preferred if they'd be able to go back to previous rooms as before that I set it so once you progressed to new rooms you could not go back. My initial idea for this was to symbolise how life keeps moving forward with no way back with no regard for your feelings. However, after the feedback, I thought about it more and really at the base what I'm creating is a game for the player to enjoy and if being able to go back and see details they might have missed without having to restart makes it more enjoyable, then I think I should make it so. Through play testing I also discovered errors I was not able to see whilst creating the level, like glitched textures and mixxing colliders which I was able to quickly discover and fix.


<ins>Artist Statement - Assignmnet 2</ins>

For this project, I created a 3D virtual environment to narrate a personal story of change—moving homes multiple times during my final year 12 exams, from the quiet suburbs into the chaos of the city. Each scene is set in a different bedroom I’ve lived in, with a brief transition moment in a moving van to help clarify the narrative. I wanted to capture the feeling of time passing, emotional weight, and growth, using the environment itself to tell the story rather than relying on dialogue or text.

Designing in 3D was a big shift from 2D work—it required a lot more iteration, planning, and especially playtesting. Having a working prototype was essential throughout the process. It helped me fine-tune the scale of rooms, test navigability, and immediately spot technical issues like missing colliders, broken lighting, or audio not playing. Playtesting also gave me insight I wouldn’t have otherwise noticed—for example, I originally designed the game to be linear with no ability to return to previous rooms, symbolising how time moves forward with no way back. But feedback made me realise players wanted to revisit scenes, so I adapted the experience to be more enjoyable.

Sound played a similar role to Assignment 1, where I used ambient music and background audio to set the emotional tone and deepen immersion. Unlike Assignment 2, I had no interactive sound effects, but audio was still central to mood-setting.

The virtual camera gave control to the player, unlike my fixed camera in Assignment 1, which helped reinforce the theme—this is your journey through my story. Over time, I added more assets, details, and lighting choices to strengthen the atmosphere and make each space feel lived-in and meaningful.
