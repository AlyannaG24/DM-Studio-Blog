# Practice Implementing Content
![figma practice](Process_practice.png)
I messed around with Figma for a bit and followed a few random tutorials I found online just to get the hang of things. It took a while to wrap my head around some of the tools, but once I got into it, it started to click. Mostly just trial and error and a lot of tired clicking, but I ended up 
learning more than I expected and it gave me a great foundation to try experimenting on my own without tutorials to guide me.

# Draft Artist Bio
Hi! My name is Alyanna Gaw and Iâ€™m a university student exploring different creative fields, with a growing passion for graphic design. Inspired by video games, music, and everyday life, my work focuses on mood, colour, and atmosphere. I enjoy experimenting with digital and interactive media to tell personal 
and engaging stories. Currently, I am considering pursuing graphic design more seriously as a future career path, driven by curiosity and a love for visual communication.

I ended up going with a warm colour palatte with oranges and yellows to reflect an inviting and friendly atmosphere. Whilst working on the first 'portfolio' title page I realised I need a visual icon or motif I could use throughout the webpage to spice things up and tie everything together with something of visual interest. 
I ended up going with a 4-tipped star.
