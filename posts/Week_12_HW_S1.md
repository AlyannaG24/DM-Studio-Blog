# Feedback
After getting feedback in class, I went back and cleaned up both my images and text. I adjusted the text size and increased the line spacing to make everything easier to read, and I narrowed the text boxes so the layout didnâ€™t feel too wide or stretched out. For the images, I cropped out any messy parts like the taskbar and added simple borders to make them look cleaner and more consistent across the pages.
