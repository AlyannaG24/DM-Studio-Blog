# Session 1
## Unity Solar System

The in class task for week 7 is to recreate the solar system using a refernce provided. This is the first  class on 3D digital design and environments and I have no previous experience with unity or any other 3D design tools. Initially I found it difficult to navigate, however after playing around with shapes (height, width, depth, position, rotation etc) and having Thomas give us a few demonstartions on how to preform actions (like how to add materials to shapes) I found it much easier to start creating the solar system model. 
I only really had trouble with crating Saturn because I didn't know how to create its rings. I figured I could make a rough shape of the rings by flattening a cylinder and positioning and rotating it so it was in the middle of the Saturn planet orb with the sides sticking out.
These are some screenshots I took of my completed solar system in Unity.

## Map Floorplan
![map plan](plan.png)
This is my initial floorplan map of my game showing my transition from my house in Sunshine to moving in the moving truck, to a temporary rental unit to my final and current appartment in the city. 

Some 3D models I'm thinking of using are: cardboard boxes to really show the 'moving house' aspect, and also to reduce the amount of assets and decor needed as they would be 'packed' in the box. I also plan on using furniture like beds, tables, trees and desks to help set the scenes of each spacial encounter. At the very end of the last spacial encounter I will have the player end up at a window or balcony where they will have a city view, I plan on using a 3D model of a city or an image to give the impression of a vast new environemnt.

Some sounds I plan on using are car/truck sounds while in th moving van to simulate the truck pulling up/parking at the temporary rental, muffled domestic sounds whilst in the rental like if you could hear the neighbours through the walls to really give off a cramped feeling, cars driving past and shouting to aid the hustle and bustle of the city.

# Preliminary List of Assets
3D: Beds, Desks, Van, Tables, Chairs, Matresses
sounds: truck sounds, ambient city sounds

This is my greybox for my series of spacial encounters. starting at the largest box on the left moving through to the final box on the bottom right.

# Anamorphism

In class we were tasked with playing around with unity and 3D shapes to create an anamorphism scene. I decided to create a floating chair
