## Unity Solar System

The in class task for week 7 is to recreate the solar system using a refernce provided. This is the first  class on 3D digital design and environments and I have no previous experience with unity or any other 3D design tools. Initially I found it difficult to navigate, however after playing around with shapes (height, width, depth, position, rotation etc) and having Thomas give us a few demonstartions on how to preform actions (like how to add materials to shapes) I found it much easier to start creating the solar system model. 
I only really had trouble with crating Saturn because I didn't know how to create its rings. I figured I could make a rough shape of the rings by flattening a cylinder and positioning and rotating it so it was in the middle of the Saturn planet orb with the sides sticking out.
These are some screenshots I took of my completed solar system in Unity.
